A web browser extension I made to easily download videos/lectures from the echo360 website used by
some of the York University professors.
It can also combine any two audio and video files.
This project is made possible using the ffmpeg tool in Web Assembly: https://github.com/ffmpegwasm/ffmpeg.wasm
